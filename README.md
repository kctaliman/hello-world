# hello-world
My first repository. 
I am a beginner programmer and I hope that I learn a lot from this website. I actually have a lot of accounts on websites that teach you how to code including codecademy, edx, codeschool, etc. I am also going to an introductory course on HTML5 and rails in 2 weeks in preparation for a coding bootcamp by next year
